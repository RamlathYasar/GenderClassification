# GenderClassification
Used four different classifiers to predict gender of a person with the data provided and compared results.
We have data regarding a person's height, weight and shoe size. We would like to make a classifier which predicts the gender of a new person using this data. We have used four different classifiers for this purpose:

1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. K Nearest neighbors
3. Kernel SVM
4. Logistic Regression
5. Naive Bayes
6. Random Forest
7. SVC (Support Vector Classifier)

We implement these seven different classifiers on our dataset using the built-in functions in scikit-learn python library and figure out which classifier gives us the maximum accuracy.
